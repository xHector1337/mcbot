# Introduction

I love playing Minecraft with my friends. Sometimes we create our own from Aternos, sometimes we join other servers such as Hypixel. When we create our servers from Aternos, queues distract us.
So I made this bot to keep our servers alive 7/24. All I have to do is running tihs bot on my Raspberry Pi. (Yeah, I have a rpi and I don't host servers on it.)

# Usage

Setup requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then edit `settings.json`. If you leave username variable empty, it'll choose one for you! Also, you can change mode as register or login. It'll either register or login to the server by using password variable.
Only one more thing left; running `bot.py`.
Enjoy your life without queues.
